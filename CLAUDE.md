# LEAPS Options Backtesting Platform - Complete Guide

## 1. Project Overview

This project provides a robust platform for backtesting LEAPS (Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities) trading strategies on GOOG. Its primary focus is on **compounding capital management** to simulate realistic portfolio performance under different market conditions.

The platform features two distinct backtesting scripts, located in the `scripts/` directory. While both test the same core strategies, they represent different philosophies: one as a direct, unconstrained model, and the other as a feature-rich, realistic simulation framework.

## 2. Core Strategies

The backtester supports two primary strategies. To isolate the performance characteristics of each market year, both strategies begin with a fresh $100,000 capital base at the start of every year.

#### a. Compounding Annual Strategy
- A single trade is placed per year using the full available capital.
- **Entry:** First trading day of the year.
- **Option:** A January LEAP for the *following* year is selected (typically ITM, with a strike closest to the stock price).
- **Position Sizing:** Buys as many contracts as possible with the available capital, factoring in a commission of $0.35 per contract.
- **Exit:** The position is held for the entire year and sold on the last trading day.

#### b. Compounding Quarterly Rolling Strategy
- A more active strategy that rolls the LEAPS position every quarter to maintain a consistent time to expiration (~15 months).
- **Cycle:** Four trades are placed per year. At the end of each quarter, the current position is sold, and the entire proceeds are reinvested.
- **Option Selection:** For each quarter, a new ~15-month LEAP is selected.
- **Position Sizing:** The same capital and commission rules are applied for each of the four trades, allowing capital to compound (or deplete) intra-year.

## 3. Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide provides a complete process to set up and run the backtesting platform from a fresh clone.

### a. Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.11+**: Ensure a recent version of Python is installed.
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The ThetaData terminal is a Java application.
    ```bash
    java -version
    ```
3.  **ThetaTerminal.jar**: Verify that the `ThetaTerminal.jar` file is present in the project's root directory.

### b. Environment File

The project requires API keys stored in a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

1.  Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Edit the new `.env` file and add your API credentials.

### c. Install Dependencies

The project's dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

1.  From the project's root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip3 install "aiohttp>=3.12.13" "numpy~=1.26.4" "pandas>=2.3.0" "pandas-ta>=0.3.14b" "python-dotenv>=1.0.1" "thetadata==0.9.11" "yfinance>=0.2.63" "python-dateutil>=2.8.2" "requests"
    ```

### d. Run a Backtest

1.  **Set Permissions:** Make the ThetaData startup script executable (one-time setup):
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/start_theta.sh
    ```
2.  **Execute a Backtest:** The scripts automatically start the ThetaData terminal.

    *   **To run the Gemini implementation (Direct Strategy Model):**
        This version is a direct, literal implementation of the core strategies. It is useful for analyzing the performance of the raw strategy itself without additional constraints.
        ```bash
        python3 scripts/run_gemini_backtest.py
        ```

    *   **To run the Claude implementation (Feature-Rich Simulation):**
        This version is a more advanced simulation framework. It includes command-line configurability, a framework for liquidity limits, and provides a much more detailed and insightful final report.
        ```bash
        python3 scripts/run_claude_backtest.py --start-year 2016 --end-year 2025
        ```

## 4. System Architecture

*   **`src/backtesting_engine/`**: The core Python package containing all logic for data handling, option selection, capital management, and trade execution.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains the two runnable backtesting scripts (`run_gemini_backtest.py` and `run_claude_backtest.py`).
*   **`CLAUDE.md` / `GTC.md`**: Project documentation and planning files.
*   **`ThetaTerminal.jar`**: The Java application required to connect to the ThetaData API.
*   **Auto-Start:** The scripts automatically check if the ThetaData terminal is running and will launch it if needed.
*   **Caching:** The first run fetches all historical trading days and caches them in `market_days_cache.json` for instant lookups.

## 5. Implementation Comparison: Gemini vs. Claude

The two implementations serve different purposes. Gemini's script provides a raw benchmark, while Claude's script is a superior tool for in-depth, realistic analysis.

| Feature | Gemini Implementation | Claude Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Direct, raw strategy backtest | Realistic, feature-rich simulation |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded values | Command-line arguments |
| **Reporting** | Basic table of results | Multi-section analytical report |
| **Insights** | Shows final P/L | Shows P/L, **plus** commission costs & trade volume |
| **Realism** | Assumes infinite liquidity | Includes a framework for liquidity limits |

### Post-Correction Analysis (2022 Results)

After fixing a critical bug in the Claude implementation, the numerical results of the two scripts are now nearly identical, as they both use the same underlying `capital_management` module. The differences are now in reporting and features, not core logic.

| Strategy (2022) | Final Return (Gemini) | Final Return (Claude) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Annual** | `-100.05%` | `-100.1%` |
| **Quarterly**| `-94.89%` | `-95.4%` |

The key takeaway is no longer about divergent results, but about the **quality of the simulation.** The Claude implementation is considered more "realistic" because:
1.  **It models constraints:** It has the built-in capability to model liquidity limits, a crucial factor for any real-world trading system.
2.  **It provides deeper insights:** Its reporting separates signal from noise, highlighting the significant impact of transaction costs (commissions) on the quarterly strategyâ€”a vital piece of analysis that the Gemini report omits.
